"iVNT networks" folder:
	Most are probably duplicates with the test team
	hangzhou_full and Huawei might be too sensitive to store since they're big customer data
	Fish.(spb/xlsx) are probably duplicated with Frankie
	unicode_network.json:
		No idea where this has come from, I think it's an iVNT network but I'd stored it separately. If it doesn't load in iVNT then just delete it, there's probably a unicode test network from the Test guys somewhere anyway, so this one would just be duplicating usefullness

"AriaOnline Demo networks" folder:
	Not necessarily an iVNT format, you'll need to test these in the latest iVNT
	If they don't load, then you should probably still store them but with a tag of "AriaOnline"

"New Model" folder:
	Both btmb networks will be duplicates with lots of people
	ghetto-network.json will be a duplicate with 1 of Frankie's
	ghett0-network-with-invalid-prop.json will be unique, but it's just ghetto-network.json with an open quote removed from one of the properties (there as a test network for upload failures)
